Module 4 pandas
After reviewing the data I have noticed 2 specific things about this group of students
More kids passed reading overall
Holden was the highest performing school based on average scores, but it had the smallest sample size. My call is thaat Cabrera high school was the best performing school overall due to having the highest overall passing rate while being in medium size bin. 
Final take away is that Charter schools out perform district schools by a pretty wide margin in overall passing rate.
